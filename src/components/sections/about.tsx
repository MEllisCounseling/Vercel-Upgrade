                Michael Ellis was born in Alexandria, VA, in 1981 and moved to Mentor, OH, a suburb of Cleveland, in 1985. 
                He grew up in a loving home with his parents and two younger brothers.

                From an early age, Michael was actively involved in his community. His church emphasized monthly service projects, 
                allowing him to develop a deep appreciation for people of all backgrounds. Through these experiences, he cultivated 
                a strong sense of compassion, recognizing the unique strengths and challenges of individuals regardless of gender, 
                nationality, or identity. His innate desire to support and uplift others became a defining part of his character.

                Michael continued to refine these qualities during his college years. He attended Baptist Bible College in Clarks Summit, PA, 
                earning a Bachelor of Science in Bible in 2003. After graduation, he served as an Assistant Pastor in Front Royal, VA, from 2003 to 2005.

                Seeking a new path, Michael transitioned into law enforcement, working as a Police Officer in Winchester, VA, from 2005 to 2007. 
                However, he soon realized that his true calling lay elsewhere. In 2007, he joined the Winchester Department of Social Services 
                as a Foster Care Worker, where he spent nine years helping vulnerable children and families. During this time, he pursued 
                higher education, earning a Master of Social Work from West Virginia University in 2011.

                Building on his experience, Michael shifted into a therapeutic role in 2016, working as a Therapeutic Day Treatment Counselor 
                for the National Counseling Group (NCG). Over the next three years, he also served as an In-Home Counselor and Clinical Supervisor.
              </p>
              <p>
                After completing the necessary supervision and obtaining his Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) title, Michael joined 
                Exhale Behavioral Health in 2019. There, he worked as an Independent Therapist until 2025, helping individuals navigate 
                life&apos;s challenges with empathy and expertise.

              Michael married Jennifer in 2003, and together they have raised five wonderful children, who now range in age from 11 to 19. 
              Reflecting on his family&apos;s impact, Michael shares, &quot;My family and children take up the bulk of my time, and I am grateful 
              for their support. They have given me invaluable experience that strengthens my ability to help others as a counselor.&quot;
